# INTRO

First of all, **Happy Valentine's Day, Yanfei! This is a present for you.**

Well, this "present" was made in PyQt4 which is a very useful libary. The work is did by me was simple. If you are interested in this repo or PyQt4, feel free to contact me. :)

Oh, this is the shortest README I believe.

# Structure

There are only two module for now, main and wizard. Main module control all logic, wizard module define wizard related functions. 

#TODO List

For now, present version1.0 is done, yeah! But there are some features maybe can be done in furture version. Here are the list:

* Redesign those pages, make it pretty
* Wizard back event, when user press back button, new windows should be opened
* Label text format doesn't look pretty at all, it can be adjust use html but I don't know how
    
 

# How to use

Just compilation main.py, very simple.
